# Single-layer-perceptron_Classification
This exercise is concerned with learning approaches for a single-layer perceptron (also know as a threshold logic unit or McCulloch-Pitts neuron) in simple binary classification problems. The two main learning algorithms considered in this lab are percpetron and delta (Widrow-Hoff) rule.
